-- ctrl + enter to run a block of code

-- Here's the tidal club sample pack for you to download: https://slab.org/tmp/samples-extra.zip
d1 $ sound "cpu:3 cpu:5 cpu:3 cpu:2"

d1 silence

-- you can also run this same sequence using 
-- this is the same as line 14
d1 $ n "3 5 3 2" # sound "cpu"

d1  silence
-- you can look at default samples at 
-- super collider -> file -> open user source directory

-- Mini-notation worksheet 1

-- Play a "kick" sound (the first one in the folder)
d1 $ sound "kick"

-- Play a different sound from the "kick" folder (the fourth one, counting from zero)
d1 $ sound "kick:3"

-- Play a kick - snare loop. Notice two sounds fit in the same time as one did above
d1 $ sound "kick snare"

-- The more you add, the faster it goes - the 'cycle' stays constant
d1 $ sound "kick snare kick snare"

d1 $ sound "kick snare kick snare kurt hi lo hi lo"

-- Again, we can pick sounds with : and a number

d1 $ sound "cpu:0 cpu:2 cpu:4 cpu:6 cpu:0 cpu:2 cpu:6 cpu:8"

-- If they're all from the same folder, it's easier to pattern
-- the sounds using a separate "n" pattern, like this:
d1 $ n "0 2 4 6 0 2 6 8" # sound "cpu"

-- `#` combines together patterns of different kinds, in this case a 'sound'
-- and an 'n' pattern.
-- We'll come back to `#` (and how it differs from '$') in the future!

-- You can have an 'empty' step, known as a musical rest, with '~'
d1 $ sound "kick snare ~ clap:4"

d1 $ n "0 2 2 ~ 8 ~ 8 ~" # sound "cpu"

-- You can also "break down" a step into a subsequence, with []

-- Lets start with a simple pattern
d1 $ sound "hi lo hi lo"

-- And squeeze a two-step subsequence inside that third step:
d1 $ sound "hi lo [hi hi] lo"

-- It works for 'n' patterns too
d1 $ n "0 1 [5 5 5] 4" # sound "drum"

-- You can even break down a step inside a subsequence:
d1 $ sound "hi lo [hi [hi lo hi lo]] lo"

-- It's easy to make nice compount time signatures:
d1 $ sound "[hi lo hi] [hi lo hi lo]"

-- Worksheet 2
-- SPEEDING UP, REPEATING, AND SLOWING DOWN

-- SPEEDING UP A STEP WITH "*"
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_f11uago28&t=105s

-- Make a step go 'faster', so it repeats itself within its step:
d1 $ sound "hi lo*3"

-- It works with subsequences too
d1 $ sound "hi [hi lo]*2"
hush

-- And 'n' patterns
d1 $ n "[0 ~ 0] 2 [0 9]*2 2" # sound "cpu"

-- Let's try speeding up a pattern by one-and-a-half:
d1 $ sound "bd [sd hc]*1.5"

-- It has two steps, so if you speed it up by 1.5, you get three steps.
-- The first time around you get "bd [sd hc sd]", the second time "bd [hc sd hc]"

-- SLOWING DOWN A STEP WITH "/"
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_f11uago28&t=346s

-- Make 'lo' sound only every other cycle:
d1 $ sound "hi lo/2"

-- Make 'lo' sound only every third cycle:
d1 $ sound "hi lo/3"

-- Slow down a subsequence, so only one step sounds per cycle:
d1 $ sound "clap [numbers:0 numbers:1 numbers:2]/3"

-- Take two steps from a six step sequence each cycle, by slowing it by 3:
d1 $ n "0 0 0 [0 1 3 4 5 6]/3" # sound "cpu2"

-- Make things strange by slowing down with funky ratios!
d1 $ n "0 0 0 [0 1 3 4 5 6]/2.5" # sound "cpu2"

-- REPEATING A STEP WITH "!"
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_f11uago28&t=275s

-- If you want to repeat steps on the same metrical level, then you can use ! ..
-- So this:
d1 $ sound "hi lo!3"

-- Is the same as this:
d1 $ sound "hi lo lo lo"

-- You can also use an ! on its own for a single repeat. So this:
d1 $ sound "hi lo !"

-- Is the same as this:
d1 $ sound "hi lo lo"

-- You can repeat subsequences too, so these are the same:
d1 $ sound "bd bd [hi lo] !"

d1 $ sound "bd bd [hi lo] [hi lo]"

-- POLYPHONY WITH ","
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_f11uago28&t=668s 

-- With ',' you can have more than one subsequence happening at the same time.
-- Where you have the possibility of more than one note happening at once,
-- that's called musical "polyphony"

-- This is like where you have multiple channels d1 and d2 active at the same time:
d1 $ sound "bd sd"

d2 $ sound "rs rs rs"

-- .. but with ","" you can put them both in the same pattern. This sounds
-- the same as the two above patterns playing at once:
d1 $ sound "[bd sd, rs rs rs]"

-- The subsequences line up to fill the same cycle.
-- So "[a b, c d e]" lines up like this:
-- |a--b--|
-- |c-d-e-|

-- There's an 'alphabet' sample set in the default samples that can help with
-- this!
d1 $ n "[0 1, 2 3 4]" # sound "alphabet"

-- There's another way of getting subsequences to align, using { } instead of [ ]:
d1 $ n "{0 1, 2 3 4}" # sound "alphabet"

-- Video explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_f11uago28&t=822s

-- The first three cycles of this looks like this:
-- |ababab|
-- |cdecde|

-- What's happening? Well Tidal aligns the first subsequence, "0 1", to fit
-- the cycle, as before. But then it fits the others to it *stepwise*. So
-- now the steps align, but the cycles don't! In the space of three
-- cycles, there are three repetitions of "a b" and two repetitions of "c d e"

-- The [ ] notation creates what is called a musical 'polyrhythm' - multiple
-- rhythms happening within the same timeframe, e.g.:
d1 $ n "[0 5 2 ~, 0 3 4*2 0 3]" # sound "cpu2"

-- The { } notation creates a 'polymetre' - where metres of different durations
-- phase in and out of each other, e.g.:
d1 $ n "{0 5 2 ~, 0 3 4*2 0 3}" # sound "cpu2"

-- I (Alex) get mixed up between polyrhythm and polymetre all the time, and
-- tend to just call them both polyrhythm for simplicity..

-- 'Traditional' music software with linear 'piano roll' style notation systems
-- can really struggle with polyrhythm/metre, but it's really easy with Tidal
-- and a *lot* of fun to explore.

-- RHYTHMIC FEET WITH "."
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_f11uago28&t=988s

-- You can 'mark out' regular rhythmic 'feet' with "."

-- So this:
d1 $ sound "bd sd . mt ht lt . arpy arpy:4 . snare clap:4 bd"


-- Is another way of saying exactly this:
d1 $ sound "[bd sd] [mt ht lt] [arpy arpy:4] [snare clap:4 bd]"

-- So the "." breaks up a sequence into parts of equal duration

-- To break down a step _within_ the "." notation, you can still
-- use [], etc:
d1 $ sound "bd sd . mt [ht mt] lt . arpy [arpy:4 arpy:5] . snare clap:4 bd"

-- That's the same as:
d1 $ sound "[bd sd] [mt [ht mt] lt] [arpy [arpy:4 arpy:5]] [snare clap:4 bd]"

-- ONE STEP PER CYCLE WITH "<>"
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_f11uago28&t=1166s

-- Often it's nice to pick one step from a subsequence every cycle.
-- One way is this:
d1 $ sound "hi [arpy arpy:1 arpy:2 arpy:3]/4"

-- You can do the same thing with < > - it picks one step per cycle, without
-- you having to worry about how many steps there are inside:
d1 $ sound "hi <arpy arpy:1 arpy:2 arpy:3>"

-- REVISION TASKS

-- Copy each of the following patterns in turn, and edit them so that they
-- are shorter, using the "<>", "!", "[]" and/or "." introduced above.

d1 $ sound "kick snare snare"

d1 $ sound "kick [snare snare]"

d1 $ sound "kick snare kick snare kick snare"

d1 $ n "0 [1 2 3]/3" # sound "cpu2"

d1 $ n "[0 0 2] [4 5 6 7] [4 1] [0 3 0 3]" # sound "cpu2"

d1 $ sound "kick snare kick snare kick snare clap"

d1 $ sound "[kick snare kick snare kick snare] clap"

d1 $ sound "bd sd sd sd bd [sd sd sd]"

-- Trying to make code as short as possible is called "golfing" for some reason.
-- It can be useful as a form of practice, but sometimes longer code
-- is actually much easier to understand and edit!

In brief:

Upgrade Tidal by opening a terminal window and running

cabal update
cabal install tidal --lib
If you're on an older version of haskell, you might have to remove the --lib and just run cabal install tidal.
If you're on a mac and get 'command not found' or similar, you might have to run . ~/.ghcup/env before the above.

The main difference is the addition of the draw function, which I use in the video to explore what the euclidean syntax is doing. There's also drawLine which I forgot to show in the video - it's actually clearer as it shows multiple cycles.. e.g.:
-}
drawLine $ "[x [a c b]/2 x x, a x [c d]]"
{-
draws:

[6 cycles]
|x--a-c---x--|x-- b-x--x--|x--a-c---x--|x-- b-x--x--|x--a-c---x--|x-- b-x--x--
|a---x---c-d-|a---x---c-d-|a---x---c-d-|a---x---c-d-|a---x---c-d-|a---x---c-d-
--I'll paste the list of example Euclidean structures below. So for the Persian rhythm "Khafif-e-ramal"
-}
d1 $ sound "clap(3,5,2)"
--It's useful to have a kick or something at the start of each cycle as a reference point:

d1 $ sound "kick:5"
